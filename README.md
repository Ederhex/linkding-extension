# linkding-extension
A simple extension for Chromium based browsers (tested on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge) for [Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding), a self hosted bookmarking service.

[Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) is not my creation, I take no credit for it whatsoever.

## Why?
Linkding provides a bookmarklet by default when you install it. I put this extension together to have quick access to adding a new bookmark as I always have the bookmarks bar of my browser hidden and I have the main Linkding screen set as my new tab page.

## Installation
* If you haven't already, install [Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) 
* Clone [this repository](https://github.com/jeroenpardon/linkding-extension) or extract the [zip package](https://github.com/jeroenpardon/linkding-extension/archive/master.zip) to a location of your choice
* Replace `example.com` with your domain in bookmarklet.js
* Enter `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/` into the adress field of your browser
* Choose "Load unpacked". If you don't see this option, you need to switch on "developer mode" first.
* The extension should pop up in your browser's toolbar
