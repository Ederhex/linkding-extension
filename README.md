# linkding-extension
A simple extension for Chromium based browsers (tested on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge) for [Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding), a self hosted bookmarking service.

Linkding is not my creation, I take no credit for it.

## Installation
* If you haven't already, install [Linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) 
* Clone this repository or extract the zip package in a location of your choice
* Replace 'example.com' with your domain in bookmarklet.js
* Enter chrome://extensions/ or edge://extensions/ into the adress field of your browser
* Choose "Load unpacked"
* The extension should pop up in your browser's toolbar
